##README

The purpose of this application is to present a simple way to forecast future energy consumption based on data received from an MQTT stream from a potential electricity meter. The application will publish its generated forecast to a new MQTT stream which can be used by a utility provider to manage their electricty production. This example uses a locally hosted MQTT system and uses an example set of data. It uses polynomial fitting to predict the next data. In the future this application can be extended using a trained model abotained through using machine learning techniques to more accurately predict future consumption. 

The following test datasets will be provided: 

- sinusoidal consumption
- linear increasing consumption
- gausiann distributed consumption  

##How to use this application:

For the forecaster to work, you must ensure that you have the appropriate dependencies. 

Python 2.7, Mosquitto, paho-mqtt, numpy


Run a local mosquitto server by entering the following command:

	mosquitto

Subscribe to MQTT stream of energy production forecasts by opening a terminal window and typing the following command:

	mosquitto_sub -v -t 'predictions/lyse-test-01'


Run the forecasting application by entering the following command:

	python forecaster.py

Finally start publishing energy consumption data every 10 seconds to an MQTT stream by entering the following command into a new terminal window:

	python publisher.py

The output from the publisher should now appear on the mqtt subscriber.
